════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. QUICK START
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REQUIREMENTS
────────────
  ✓ Modern browser (Chrome/Edge recommended for full features)
  ✓ No external dependencies needed

OPTION A: Windows Quick Launch (Recommended)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. Double-click launcher.bat
  2. Chrome opens automatically with --disable-web-security flag
  3. Start editing!
  
  This opens index.html directly via file:// protocol with security disabled,
  allowing the app to read data/map-data.json without a local server.
  
  ⚠️  WARNING: A temporary Chrome session is created. Only use this browser
      window for the map editor - do not browse other sites!

OPTION B: Manual Setup with HTTP Server (Any OS)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. Open terminal in the this folder
  2. Start HTTP server:
    - Python:  python -m http.server 8000
    - Node:    npx http-server -p 8000
    - PHP:     php -S localhost:8000
  3. Open browser to: http://localhost:8000
  4. Ctrl+C or close the terminal to terminate the server

OPTION C: Direct File Open + Upload
─────────────────────────────────────
  1. Open index.html directly in any browser (file://)
  2. The app will start with an empty map (JSON loading fails)
  3. Click the Edit Mode button → click 💾 Data Manage tool → "Upload JSON"
  4. Select your existing map-data.json file to load it
  
  This works in any browser without security workarounds, but requires
  manual upload each time you open the file.

FIRST STEPS
───────────
  1. Click the › button (top-left) to open Edit Mode
  2. Click 🖼️ Image tool in the left panel → Add your first map layer
  3. Click 📍 Mark tool in the left panel → Add interactive markers
  4. Click 💾 in the top bar → Select save location (Chrome/Edge only)
  5. Click ‹ to exit Edit Mode and test navigation

Your map auto-loads from data/map-data.json on startup if it exists.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
2. CORE CONCEPTS
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HIERARCHICAL ZOOM SYSTEM
─────────────────────────
Think Google Maps, but for your custom worlds:

  Scale 1.0 (zoomed out)  →  World Map visible
  Scale 3.0               →  Continent Map appears, World fades
  Scale 10.0              →  City Map appears, Continent fades  
  Scale 50.0 (zoomed in)  →  Building Interior appears

Each image defines appear scale (when it appears).
This creates smooth zoom-dependent layer transitions.

PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIPS
──────────────────────────
Images can be parents to other images:
  
  • Child are RELATIVE to parent
  • Children only visible when parent is visible
  • Moving parent moves all children with it
  • Enables complex nested structures

Example hierarchy:
  World (parent: none, minScale: 0)
  └─ Kingdom (parent: World, minScale: 5)
     └─ City (parent: Kingdom, minScale: 15)
        └─ Castle (parent: City, minScale: 40)

MARKS: TWO TYPES
────────────────
  Node Marks:    Attached to specific images (relative coordinates)
                 → Move with parent, inherit visibility
                 → Good for: Room details, city features

  General Marks: Standalone at fixed world coordinates
                 → Always visible (or attached to image parent)
                 → Good for: Major landmarks, quest locations

SPATIAL AUDIO ZONES
───────────────────
Rectangular areas that trigger looping audio when the viewport center enters:
  
  • Scale-dependent: Only play within zoom range
  • Priority system: Higher appear scale = higher priority
  • Only one sound plays at a time

ASSET GALLERY
─────────────
Centralized library for reusable images and sounds:
  
  • Folder organization (nested folders supported)
  • Reference counting (see what's in use)
  • Drag-and-drop uploads
  • Gallery items stored as base64 in JSON

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
3. NAVIGATION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The application auto-detects your input method and optimizes behavior:

MOUSE NAVIGATION
────────────────
  Pan:   Click and drag canvas
  Zoom:  Scroll wheel (10% per tick)
         • Scroll up = zoom in
         • Scroll down = zoom out
         • Zoom centers on cursor position

TOUCHPAD NAVIGATION
───────────────────
  Pan:   Two-finger scroll (horizontal or vertical)
         • Speed scales with zoom (faster when zoomed out)
         • Zero sensitivity threshold (responsive to small movements)
  
  Zoom:  Ctrl + Scroll OR Pinch gesture (OS-dependent)
         • 7.5% per tick (slower than mouse for precision)
         • Zoom centers on cursor position

TOUCHSCREEN NAVIGATION
──────────────────────
  Pan:   One-finger drag
  Zoom:  Two-finger pinch
         • Zoom centers on midpoint between fingers
         • Smooth distance-based scaling

  Note: Three or more fingers → only first two used

VIEW CONTROLS (Top-Right)
─────────────────────────
  📍/👺/🗺️  Mark Visualizer Button (cycles through 4 modes):
            • 📍 Land marks only (dots, cities, dungeons, etc.)
            • 👺 Enemy marks only (boss encounters)
            • 🗺️ All marks visible
            • 📍 (faded) No marks

  🔊/🔇     Sound Toggle:
            • ON: Plays audio when entering zones
            • OFF: Stops all audio immediately

  x: Y: Z:  Debug Info (position and zoom scale)

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
──────────────────
  E              Toggle Edit Mode on/off
  N              Cycle mark display mode (land → enemy → all → none)
  M              Toggle sound on/off
  + / =          Zoom in
  - / _          Zoom out
  Arrow keys     Pan map
  Ctrl+Z         Undo last action
  Ctrl+Y         Redo last undone action
  Ctrl+S         Download/save map data
  Esc            Close gallery or exit Edit Mode

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
4. EDIT MODE OVERVIEW
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ACTIVATION
──────────
Click the thin › button (top-left) → Three panels slide in simultaneously

INTERFACE LAYOUT
────────────────
  The Edit Mode UI consists of three separate panels:

  › / ‹ Toggle Button (top-left edge):
    • A button always visible at the screen edge
    • › — Edit Mode off (click to open)
    • ‹ — Edit Mode on (click to close)
    • Shifts right automatically when panels open to stay accessible

  Left Icon Strip (slides in from left):
    • Vertical panel with one button per tool
    • 🤚 Drag    — Navigation only, sidebar hidden
    • 🖼️ Image   — Add/edit map layers
    • 📍 Mark    — Add/edit markers
    • 🔊 Sound   — Add/edit audio zones
    • ───────
    • 🗂️ Gallery  — Open gallery manager
    • 💾 Data     — Download/upload JSON
    • Hover over any icon to see its label
    • Active tool highlighted with orange border

  Top Bar (slides down from top-center):
    • Map Name: editable inline (shown in orange, updates browser title)
    • Selection Filters: 🖼️ 📍 🔊 — toggle which element types
                         can be selected by clicking the canvas
    • Scale Range: Min – Max appear scale for canvas selection
    • ↶ / ↷: Undo / Redo buttons (up to 100 steps)
    • 💾: Auto-save toggle
    • 🪲: Bug report email link

  Sidebar (slides in when a tool is selected):
    • Opens next to the left icon strip when clicking Image/Mark/Sound
    • Contains the form and management list for the active tool
    • Closes when switching to Drag mode or clicking empty canvas

SELECTION FILTERS vs. VISIBILITY
──────────────────────────────────
  These are two separate systems:

  Top bar filters (🖼️ 📍 🔊 and scale range):
    → Control which element types can be SELECTED by clicking the canvas
    → Affect only Edit Mode canvas interaction
    → Do not hide elements from view

  Top-right buttons (📍 mode and 🔊 toggle):
    → Control what is VISIBLE during playback/navigation
    → Work in both Edit Mode and View Mode

CANVAS CLICK (Unified Selection)
─────────────────────────────────
In Edit Mode, clicking the canvas selects and loads the nearest element
into the appropriate form. No need to pre-select the matching tool.

  Priority (highest to lowest): Mark → Sound → Image

  • The app checks each type if its filter is enabled (top bar)
  • The scale range filter restricts selection to elements whose
    appear scale falls within [min, max]
  • On match: auto-switches to the correct tool, opens the sidebar,
    and loads the element's data into the form
  • Clicking empty space or an unselectable element: switches to
    Drag mode and closes the sidebar

  Example: with all filters on, clicking near a city mark while an
  image is behind it → loads the mark (marks have highest priority)

WORKFLOW
────────
  Add:      Select tool → Fill form → Click "Add [Type]" button
  Edit:     Click element on canvas (auto-switches) OR click Edit in list
  Delete:   Click trash icon in management list
  Reorder:  Drag items by ⋮⋮ handle
  Search:   Type in search box to filter lists

UNDO / REDO
───────────
  ↶ / ↷ buttons in top bar, or Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y
  
  • Up to 100 steps (oldest discarded when limit reached)
  • Tracks: all image/mark/sound/gallery create, update, delete,
    reorder operations, and map name changes
  • Redo stack cleared when a new action is recorded
  • History cleared on data upload or fresh load

SPECIAL FEATURES
────────────────
  • Real-time preview: See changes as you edit (before submitting)
  • Unsaved indicator: Yellow dot appears near 💾 when there are
    changes not yet written to disk
  • Form validation: Required fields marked with *
  • Success messages: Confirm operations (auto-hide after 3 seconds)
  • Pick buttons: Click canvas to auto-fill coordinates

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
5. IMAGES (Hierarchical Layers)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Images form the foundation of your map - they can be standalone or hierarchical.

ADDING AN IMAGE
───────────────

[Name] (Optional)
  Human-readable identifier
  Example: "Kingdom of Eldoria", "Tavern Interior"
  Used in: Management lists, parent dropdowns

[URL] (Required)
  Image source - four options:
  
  1. Relative path:     img/world-map.png
  2. Absolute URL:      https://example.com/map.jpg
  3. Gallery reference: Select via "🖼️ Open Gallery" button
  4. Base64 data URI:   Drag & drop file onto upload area

  Drag & Drop Upload:
    • Drag image onto upload area OR click to browse
    • File is saved to gallery root folder
    • Shows preview thumbnail + file info
    • Pro: Portable, reusable (no external files needed)
    • Con: Bloats JSON size (~33% larger than original)

[Position X, Y] (Required)
  Center point in world coordinates
  
  • Units: Arbitrary (suggest pixels for 1:1 at scale 1.0)
  • Origin: (0, 0) = canvas center
  • Axes: +X right, -X left, +Y down, -Y up
  • Pick button: Click canvas to auto-fill current cursor position
  • Coordinates are always absolute (world space)

[Appear Scale] (Required)
  Minimum zoom level for image to appear
  
  • 0 = always visible when zoomed out
  • Higher values = appears only when zoomed in
  • Examples:
      Scale: 0 → World map (base layer)
      Scale: 5 → Continent (appears at 5x zoom)
      Scale: 20 → City (appears at 20x zoom)

[Size] (Required)
  Display dimensions in world units
  
  • Relative to actual image dimensions (aspect ratio preserved)
  • Examples at scale 1.0:
      Width: 1000, Height: 600 → image is 1000×600 screen pixels
      Width: 500, Height: 500 → image is 500×500 screen pixels

[Parent] (Optional)
  Link to parent image for hierarchical nesting
  
  • "None" = root level (top of hierarchy)
  • Select parent = child of that image
  
  Child behavior:
    • Only visible when parent is visible
    • Inherits parent's zoom constraints
  
  ⚠️  WARNING: Not allowed circular references (A→B→C→A)
  ⚠️  WARNING: Not allowed self as parent

OPERATIONS
──────────

Add:
  Fill form → "Add Image" button
  → Image appears on canvas
  → Added to config array (or parent.children if parent selected)

Edit:
  Click image on canvas OR click edit icon in list
  → Form populates with data
  → Button changes to "Update Image"
  → Modify fields → "Update Image" → Saves changes

Canvas Drag / Resize (while image is loaded in form):
  An orange dashed border and 4 corner handles appear on the selected image.
  
  Move:   Click and drag the image body on canvas
          → X, Y fields update live as you drag
  
  Resize: Click and drag a corner handle
          → Scales uniformly (aspect ratio preserved)
          → Size field updates live as you drag
  
  Requirements:
    • Image must be currently loaded in the form (after clicking it or Edit)
    • 🖼️ selection filter must be enabled in the top bar
    • Ctrl key must NOT be held (Ctrl = pan the map)
    • Marks and sounds take higher priority — if one is under the cursor,
      the image drag won't start
  
  Note: Changes are live on canvas but only saved when clicking "Update Image"

Delete:
  Click trash icon in list
  → Confirmation dialog
  → Deletes image AND all descendants (recursive)
  → Orphans any marks attached to deleted images

Reorder:
  Drag by ⋮⋮ handle in list
  → Changes rendering order (last rendered = on top)
  → Only reorders siblings (same parent)
  → Affects click detection priority

MANAGEMENT LIST
───────────────
Located below the form:

  • Hierarchical tree view (expandable parents)
  • Shows: Indentation, name
  • Search: Filters by name
    ☐ Show children checkbox: Include nested images in search
  • Drag handles: Reorder items
  • Edit button: Load into form
  • Delete button: Remove (with confirmation)

TIPS
────
  • Progressive scales: Use 0, 3, 6, 9, 12... for smooth transitions
  • Reasonable sizes: Very large images (>10MB) may cause lag
  • External files: Better performance than base64 for large images
  • Test zoom ranges: Verify no gaps or unexpected overlaps

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
6. MARKS (Interactive Markers)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Marks are interactive points of interest with hover tooltips.

SEVEN MARK TYPES
────────────────
  
  dot       🔴 Generic location marker
  city      🏰 Towns, settlements, capitals
  dungeon   🕳️  Caves, underground areas
  fight     ⚔️  Battle sites, arenas
  treasure  💎 Loot locations, rewards
  landmark  🚩 Notable features, monuments
  enemy     👺 Boss encounters, monster lairs

Icons are 24×24px SVG files in mark/ folder (can be customized).

MARK TYPES: NODE VS GENERAL
────────────────────────────

Node Marks (attached to images):
  • Stored as properties on the image node (mark, markType)
  • Visibility: Inherits parent's visibility rules
  • Use case: Room features, city details

General Marks (standalone):
  • Position in absolute world coordinates (or relative if parent selected)
  • Stored in: generalMarks[] array
  • Visibility: Always visible (or follows parent if attached)
  • Use case: Major landmarks, quest markers

ADDING A MARK
─────────────

[Mark Type] (Required)
  Attachment mode:
  • Node Mark: Attached to a specific image, stored with that image
  • General Mark: Standalone at world coordinates (or relative to parent)

[Select Node] (Required for Node marks)

MARK VISUALIZER
───────────────
Button in top-right corner (📍/👺/🗺️) cycles through 4 modes:

  Mode 0 (📍): Land marks only
               Shows: dot, city, dungeon, fight, treasure, landmark
               Hides: enemy

  Mode 1 (👺): Enemy marks only
               Shows: enemy
               Hides: all others

  Mode 2 (🗺️):  All marks visible
               Shows: everything

  Mode 3 (📍 faded): No marks
               Hides: everything

Purpose: Focus on different marker types during gameplay or editing

OPERATIONS
──────────

Add:
  Fill form → "Add Mark" button
  → Mark appears on canvas
  → Coordinates auto-adjusted based on parent type

Edit:
  Click mark on canvas OR edit icon in list
  → Form populates
  → Button becomes "Update Mark"
  → Modify → "Update Mark"
  → Handles parent type changes (converts coordinates)

Canvas Drag (while General mark is loaded in form):
  Move:   Click and drag the mark icon on canvas to reposition it
          → X, Y fields update live as you drag
  
  Requirements:
    • Only works for General marks (Node marks have no independent position)
    • Mark must be currently loaded in the form
    • 📍 selection filter must be enabled in the top bar
    • Ctrl key must NOT be held (Ctrl = pan the map)
  
  Note: Changes are live on canvas but only saved when clicking "Update Mark"

Delete:
  Click trash icon
  → Confirmation dialog
  → Deletes mark

Reorder:
  Drag by ⋮⋮ handle
  → Changes rendering/click priority
  → Cannot reorder across node/general boundary

MANAGEMENT LIST
───────────────
  • Grouped by parent (By image first, then general)
  • Shows: Name, position
  • Search: Filters name
  • Click mark on canvas or in list to edit

TIPS
────
  • Enemy marks: Great for tracking boss encounters, can filter separately
  • Parent linking: Use for context-specific markers
  • Tooltips: Keep descriptions concise (long text may overflow screen)
  • Position precision: Zoom in before using Pick button for accuracy

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
7. SOUNDS (Spatial Audio)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Rectangular zones that play looping audio based on viewport position and zoom.

AUDIO BEHAVIOR
──────────────

Playback triggers when ALL conditions met:
  1. Sound toggle enabled (🔊 button)
  2. Viewport center inside zone rectangle
  3. Current zoom scale >= sound's min scale
  4. Current zoom scale <= sound's max scale (if set)
  5. User has interacted with page (browser autoplay policy)

Playback characteristics:
  • Volume: Per-zone adjustable, 0–100% slider (default: 100%)
  • Loop: Continuous while in zone
  • Transitions: Instant start/stop (no fade)
  • Priority: Higher min scale sound plays (if zones overlap)

ADDING A SOUND
──────────────

[Name] (Optional)
  Display name (shown in zone labels and lists)
  Example: "Forest Ambience", "Town Music"

[URL] (Required)
  Audio source - four options:
  
  1. Relative path:     sound/forest-ambience.mp3
  2. Absolute URL:      https://example.com/audio.ogg
  3. Gallery reference: Select via "🎵 Open Gallery" button
  4. Base64 data URI:   Drag & drop file onto upload area

  Format recommendations:
    • MP3: Best browser compatibility
    • OGG: Good compression, not IE11
    • WAV: Uncompressed, very large files
    • M4A: Good quality, variable support

  Drag & Drop Upload:
    • Same as images (converts to base64)
    • WARNING: Audio files can be very large
    • 10MB audio → ~13MB base64 → bloats JSON significantly
    • Recommendation: Use gallery or external files for audio

[Zone Corner 1 X, Y] (Required)
  First corner of rectangular zone
  Pick button: Click canvas to set coordinates

[Zone Corner 2 X, Y] (Required)
  Opposite corner of rectangular zone
  Pick button: Click canvas to set coordinates
  
  Notes:
    • Corners can be in any order (auto-normalized)
    • Rectangle is axis-aligned (no rotation)
    • Visual zone outline shown in Edit Mode

[Min Scale] (Required)
  Minimum zoom level for playback
  
  • 0 = plays at all zoom levels
  • Higher values = only plays when zoomed in
  • ALSO determines priority (see below)

[Max Scale] (Optional)
  Maximum zoom level for playback
  
  • Empty = no limit (plays at all high zoom levels)
  • Use to stop sound when zooming too far in

[Volume] (Optional)
  Playback volume for this zone
  
  • Slider: 0–100% (default: 100%)

[Parent Image] (Optional)
  Links this sound zone to a parent image so it transforms automatically
  when the parent is updated with "Update Children" checked.
  
  • "None" = independent (default)
  • Zone coordinates and scale values are adjusted proportionally
  • Scale values rounded to 1 decimal after adjustment
  • Works for sounds parented to any descendant in the subtree

PRIORITY SYSTEM
───────────────
When multiple sound zones overlap, priority determined by min scale:

  First matching zone plays (HIGHER min scale = HIGHER priority)

Example at scale 10:
  Zone A (min scale: 0, in range)   ← Priority 3 (lowest)
  Zone B (min scale: 5, in range)   ← Priority 2
  Zone C (min scale: 8, in range)   ← Priority 1 (highest) → PLAYS

This ensures "closer" sounds (higher zoom = closer = higher min scale) override 
distant ambient sounds.

Manual priority control: Reorder sounds in management list (first = highest 
priority when min scale values equal).

OPERATIONS
──────────

Add:
  Fill form → "Add Sound" button
  → Zone appears on canvas (colored rectangle with label)
  → Format: "Name (min-max)" or "Name (min+)"

Edit:
  Click inside zone on canvas OR edit icon in list
  → Form populates
  → Button becomes "Update Sound"
  → Zone highlighted with red outline
  → Modify → "Update Sound"

Canvas Drag / Resize (while sound is loaded in form):
  4 corner handles (circles) appear on the corners of the selected zone.
  
  Move:   Click and drag inside the zone body
          → All four corner fields (x1, y1, x2, y2) update live
  
  Resize: Click and drag a corner handle
          → Each corner controls its own x and y pair independently
          → Corner fields update live as you drag
  
  Requirements:
    • Sound must be currently loaded in the form
    • 🔊 selection filter must be enabled in the top bar
    • Ctrl key must NOT be held (Ctrl = pan the map)
    • Marks take higher priority — if a mark is under the cursor,
      the sound drag won't start
  
  Note: Changes are live on canvas but only saved when clicking "Update Sound"

Delete:
  Click trash icon → Confirmation dialog
  → Stops audio if currently playing

Reorder:
  Drag by ⋮⋮ handle
  → Changes priority for overlapping zones

MANAGEMENT LIST
───────────────
  • Shows: Name
  • Search: Filters by name
  • Edit/delete buttons
  • Drag handles for reordering

TIPS
────
  • Seamless loops: Ensure audio files loop smoothly (no clicks)
  • MP3 format: Best compatibility across browsers
  • Small files: Compress audio (64-128kbps adequate for ambient)
  • User interaction: Click page first (browser autoplay policy)
  • Testing: Enable sound toggle (🔊) and check scale range

GALLERY OPERATIONS
──────────────────

Upload Files:
  1. Drag files onto content area (or breadcrumb for specific folder)
  2. System validates file type (images for Images tab, audio for Sounds tab)
  3. Reads file as base64 via FileReader
  4. Generates unique ID (timestamp-based)
  5. Stores in gallery[] array
  6. Auto-saves if enabled
  
  Multiple files: Processes all valid files in batch
  Invalid types: Skipped with console warning

Create Folder:
  1. Click "📁 New Folder"
  2. Enter folder name (no / or \ characters allowed)
  3. Folder created in current location
  4. Appears at top of list

Rename Item:
  Double-click item name → Edit inline → Press Enter or click away
  
    ⚠️  WARNING: No renaming folders.

Move Item:
  Drag file item onto folder or breadcrumb segment
  → Updates item.folder field
  → Item appears in new location
  
  Note: Cannot move folders (only files draggable)

Update Item:
  Click ↻ button
  → Select new file
  → Replace old file

Delete Item:
  Click × button (only shown if deletable)
  
  Files: Can delete if reference count = 0
  Folders: Can delete if empty (no items, no subfolders)

Select Item (Selection Mode):
  When opened from Image/Sound form:
    Click item → URL field auto-fills with "gallery:ID"
    → Gallery closes automatically
    → Form ready to submit

Reference Counting:
  System scans all images and sounds for gallery references
  • Counts: src="gallery:ID"
  • Color: Blue if 0 (deletable), green if >0 (protected)

FOLDER STRUCTURE
────────────────

Paths:
  Root:      "image" or "sound" (type prefix)
  Subfolder: "image/maps"
  Nested:    "image/maps/cities"

Folder objects:
  {
    id: "unique-timestamp",
    type: "folder",
    content: "image",           // parent type
    name: "maps",
    folder: "image/maps",       // full path
    date: "2026-01-15T..."
  }

File objects:
  {
    id: "unique-timestamp",
    type: "image",              // or "sound"
    content: "data:image/png;base64,...",
    name: "world-map.png",
    folder: "image/maps",
    date: "2026-01-15T..."
  }

GALLERY vs DIRECT FILES
───────────────────────

Gallery advantages:
  ✓ Reusable across multiple images/sounds
  ✓ Organized in folders
  ✓ Reference counting (know what's in use)
  ✓ Rename/move without editing each reference
  ✓ Single source of truth

Gallery disadvantages:
  ✗ All stored in JSON (can bloat file size)
  ✗ Large galleries slow down save/load
  ✗ No thumbnail caching (regenerated each time)

Recommendation:
  • Gallery: Frequently reused assets, small-medium files
  • Direct files: Large assets, one-time use, external hosting

TIPS
────
  • Organize early: Create folder structure before uploading
  • Name consistently: Use prefixes like "map-", "icon-", "bgm-"
  • Avoid renaming folders: Breaks hierarchy (known limitation)
  • Performance: Large galleries (>20 items) may slow down
  • File size: Consider external files for large assets

  ⚠️  WARNING: The maximum gallery size is 500MB

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
9. AUTO-SAVE & DATA MANAGEMENT
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Multiple ways to persist your map data:

AUTO-SAVE (Chrome/Edge/Opera only)
───────────────────────────────────

Uses File System Access API to save directly to your file system.

Setup (first time):
  1. Open Edit Mode (› button)
  2. Click "💾" button in the top bar
  3. Browser shows file picker dialog
  4. Select existing map-data.json OR create new file
  5. Button turns green (auto-save active)

Subsequent behavior:
  • Every edit triggers automatic save
  • No need to click save manually
  • Button remains green while active
  • Click again to toggle on/off (file handle preserved)

What triggers auto-save:
  ✓ Add/update/delete images
  ✓ Add/update/delete marks
  ✓ Add/update/delete sounds
  ✓ Reorder any items
  ✓ Upload to gallery
  ✓ Create/rename/delete gallery items
  ✓ Upload data file

What doesn't trigger:
  ✗ Navigation (pan/zoom)
  ✗ Typing in form fields (only on submit)
  ✗ Canvas clicks
  ✗ View toggles (mark mode, sound)

Limitations:
  • Chrome/Edge/Opera only (Firefox/Safari not supported)
  • File handle lost on page reload (must reselect)
  • No backup history (always overwrites)
  • No conflict resolution (last write wins)
  • One file handle per tab (no multi-tab sync)

Recommendations:
  • Save to: data/map-data.json (auto-loads on next startup)
  • Backup regularly: Use Download button before major changes
  • One tab only: Avoid editing same map in multiple tabs

MANUAL DOWNLOAD (All browsers)
───────────────────────────────

Click "💾 Download" button:
  → Generates JSON file from current state
  → Triggers browser download dialog
  → Filename: map-data.json
  → Location: Browser's Downloads folder

Use cases:
  • Creating backups
  • Sharing maps with others
  • Versioning (rename to map-v1.json, map-v2.json, etc.)
  • Firefox/Safari workflow (no auto-save)

Format:
  {
    "mapName": "...",       // Optional map name
    "config": [...],        // Hierarchical images
    "generalMarks": [...],  // Standalone marks
    "sounds": [...],        // Audio zones
    "gallery": [...]        // Asset library
  }

⚠️  WARNING: If gallery data exceeds 500MB, the download will fail.
             Use external file paths (img/, sound/ folders) instead of
             gallery storage for large maps.

MANUAL UPLOAD (All browsers)
─────────────────────────────

Click "📁 Upload" button:
  → Opens file picker
  → Select JSON file
  → Validates structure
  → Disable auto-save if enabled
  → Replaces ALL current data
  → Renders canvas with new data

Validation checks:
  ✓ Valid JSON syntax
  ✓ Contains config, generalMarks, sounds arrays
  ✓ Gallery array (optional, defaults to empty)

⚠️  WARNING: Upload replaces everything. No merge capability.

Use cases:
  • Loading backups
  • Switching between map projects
  • Importing shared maps
  • Restoring after mistakes

AUTO-LOAD ON STARTUP
─────────────────────

Application automatically fetches data/map-data.json on page load:
  • If exists: Loads data
  • If missing: Starts with empty map
  • If malformed: Logs error, starts empty

This enables seamless workflow: Edit → Auto-save → Reload → Continues where left off

DATA FILE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS
──────────────────────────────

JSON can grow very large due to base64 encoding:

  Original image: 5 MB
  Base64 encoded: ~6.7 MB (+33%)
  Multiple images: 10 × 5MB = 67 MB JSON file

Performance impacts:
  • Save time: >50MB may freeze UI for seconds
  • Load time: Large JSON takes longer to parse
  • Download: Browsers may fail >500MB downloads
  • Memory: Large base64 strings consume RAM
  • Auto-save: Automatically blocked when data exceeds 500MB for safety reasons

Solutions:
  ✓ Use external files in img/ and sound/ folders (relative paths)
  ✓ Compress images before uploading
  ✓ Use gallery sparingly for large assets

Recommendation:
  • Prototyping: Base64 OK (portable, self-contained)
  • Production: External files (better performance)

COORDINATES SYSTEM
──────────────────

Origin: (0, 0) = center of canvas
Axes:   +X right, -X left, +Y down, -Y up
Units:  Arbitrary (recommend pixels for 1:1 at scale 1.0)

Scale factor: Zooming is exponential (each scroll multiplies scale by 1.1 or 0.9)
              Example: 1.0 → 1.1 → 1.21 → 1.33 → 1.46 (consistent 10% steps)

MARK TYPES
──────────

Available types: dot, city, dungeon, fight, treasure, landmark, enemy

Icons stored in: mark/dot.svg, mark/city.svg, ... mark/enemy.svg

Custom icons: Replace SVG files (maintain 24×24px size)

AUDIO FORMATS
─────────────

Recommended: MP3 (universal browser support)
Supported: OGG, WAV, M4A (browser-dependent)
Volume: Adjustable per zone via slider (0-100%, stored in JSON)

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
11. TIPS & BEST PRACTICES
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PERFORMANCE
───────────

Images:
  • Compress before uploading (Photoshop, TinyPNG, ImageOptim)
  • Reasonable dimensions (4096×4096 max recommended)
  • Use JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics
  • External files > base64 for large images

Sounds:
  • 64-128kbps MP3 adequate for ambient audio
  • Trim silence from start/end
  • Use mono instead of stereo when possible
  • Create seamless loops (no clicks at loop point)

Gallery:
  • Keep under 40 items for good performance
  • Use folders to organize (improves browsing)
  • Delete unused assets regularly

Hierarchy:
  • Limit nesting depth (<20 levels recommended)
  • Test zoom transitions for smooth experience
  • Avoid overlapping minScale values (causes flicker)

WORKFLOW
────────

Planning:
  • Sketch hierarchy on paper first
  • Define scale ranges before creating images
  • Use consistent coordinate system

Organization:
  • Name everything descriptively
  • Use prefixes: "map-", "icon-", "bgm-", "sfx-"
  • Create folder structure early
  • Document complex setups in separate notes

Editing:
  • Enable auto-save at start of session
  • Test frequently in View Mode
  • Use search to find items quickly
  • Click canvas elements for fast editing

Backup:
  • Download before major changes
  • Use version numbering (map-v1.json, map-v2.json)
  • Keep project files in version control (Git)

SCALE RANGES
────────────

Progressive reveal strategy:

  Base layer:    minScale 0,  maxScale 3
  Level 2:       minScale 3,  maxScale 9
  Level 3:       minScale 9,  maxScale 27
  Detail layer:  minScale 27, maxScale (empty)

Pattern: Each level 3× the previous (smooth progression)

No overlap: Prevents both layers visible simultaneously

SOUND DESIGN
────────────

Ambient layers:
  • Wide area, low minScale: General ambience (forest, ocean)
  • Medium area, mid minScale: Regional sounds (village, cave)
  • Small area, high minScale: Specific sounds (waterfall, fire)

Priority ensures detail sounds override general ambience.

MARKER STRATEGY
───────────────

Node marks: Contextual details
  • Room features in buildings
  • Shop signs in cities
  • Hazards in dungeons

General marks: Major waypoints
  • Quest objectives
  • Fast travel points  
  • Story locations

Enemy marks: Combat tracking
  • Boss encounters
  • Monster lairs
  • Filtered separately for gameplay

COMMON PATTERNS
───────────────

World → Region → Location:
  World map (scale 0-5)
  └─ Continent (scale 5-15)
     └─ Kingdom (scale 15-30)
        └─ City (scale 30-100)
           └─ Building (scale 100+)

Overworld + Dungeons:
  Overworld (scale 0-10, general marks)
  Dungeon A (scale 10-50, node marks)
  Dungeon B (scale 10-50, node marks)
  [Separate hierarchies, no parent link]

Battle map:
  Tactical grid (scale 50-200)
  └─ Character markers (enemy type)
  └─ Terrain features (landmark type)
  └─ Objectives (treasure type)

12. TROUBLESHOOTING
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BLANK PAGE / WON'T LOAD
───────────────────────

Symptom: Nothing appears, blank black screen

Causes & Solutions:
  ✗ Opened file:// directly
    → Must use HTTP server (see Quick Start)
  
  ✗ map-data.json malformed
    → Check browser console (F12) for errors
    → Validate JSON syntax (jsonlint.com)
    → Try uploading known-good JSON
  
  ✗ JavaScript errors
    → Open console (F12), check for errors
    → Report to ime.bugreport@gmail.com

IMAGES NOT DISPLAYING
─────────────────────

Symptom: Blank canvas or missing images

Causes & Solutions:
  ✗ Wrong file path
    → Verify file exists at specified path
    → Use relative paths: img/myimage.png
    → Check case sensitivity (image.PNG vs image.png)
  
  ✗ Scale range wrong
    → Check minScale isn't too high for current zoom
    → Try setting minScale to 0 temporarily
    → Verify maxScale > minScale (if set)
  
  ✗ Parent image not visible
    → Child images only show when parent shows
    → Check parent's scale range
  
  ✗ CORS blocked (external URLs)
    → Server must send Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
    → Or use base64 embedding instead
  
  ✗ Gallery reference broken
    → Gallery item was deleted
    → Update URL to new gallery item or direct path

MARKS NOT SHOWING
─────────────────

Symptom: Markers invisible or wrong type showing

Causes & Solutions:
  ✗ Mark visualizer mode wrong
    → Click 📍 button to cycle to "All marks" (🗺️)
    → Mode 0: Only land marks (enemy hidden)
    → Mode 1: Only enemy marks
    → Mode 3: All marks hidden
  
  ✗ Parent image not visible
    → Node marks inherit parent visibility
    → Check parent image scale range
  
  ✗ Position off-screen
    → Mark may be far from current view
    → Check x/y values in management list
    → Use search to find and edit

SOUNDS NOT PLAYING
──────────────────

Symptom: No audio, or wrong audio playing

Causes & Solutions:
  ✗ Sound toggle disabled
    → Click 🔊 button to enable
  
  ✗ Not in zone
    → Viewport CENTER must be inside zone rectangle
    → Zoom in/out to see zone outline (Edit Mode)
  
  ✗ Wrong scale
    → Check minScale and maxScale values
    → Current scale must be in range
  
  ✗ No user interaction yet
    → Browser autoplay policy requires click/touch first
    → Click anywhere on page, then try
  
  ✗ Priority conflict
    → Multiple zones overlap, only first plays
    → Check minScale values (higher = higher priority)
    → Reorder sounds in management list
  
  ✗ Invalid audio file
    → Check file format (MP3 recommended)
    → Test URL directly in browser
    → Check browser console for errors
  
  ✗ Volume too low
    → Adjust per-zone volume slider (0-100%), check system volume
    → Check browser isn't muted

AUTO-SAVE NOT WORKING
─────────────────────

Symptom: Changes don't persist, button stays gray

Causes & Solutions:
  ✗ Wrong browser
    → Use Chrome, Edge, or Opera
    → Firefox/Safari don't support File System Access API
    → Use manual Download/Upload instead
  
  ✗ File deleted/moved
    → File handle became invalid
    → Click Auto button again to reselect file
  
  ✗ Permission denied
    → Grant file access when browser prompts
    → Check file isn't read-only
  
  ✗ File handle lost
    → Page reload loses handle (known limitation)
    → Relink by clicking Auto button

CLICK-TO-EDIT NOT WORKING
──────────────────────────

Symptom: Clicking canvas doesn't load item into form

Causes & Solutions:
  ✗ Not in Edit Mode
    → Click the › button first
  
  ✗ Selection filter disabled
    → Check the top bar filters (🖼️ 📍 🔊)
    → The filter for that element type must be enabled
  
  ✗ Scale range mismatch
    → Check the Scale min–max inputs in the top bar
    → The element's appear scale must fall in that range
    → Set range to 0–∞ to select everything
  
  ✗ Overlapping elements
    → Priority: Marks (highest) → Sounds → Images (lowest)
    → Disable the unwanted filter type in the top bar
    → Or use the management list Edit button instead
  
  ✗ Element not visible
    → Item may be outside its zoom range
    → Zoom to the correct level first

GALLERY ISSUES
──────────────

Gallery won't open:
  → Check browser console for errors
  → Try closing and reopening Edit Mode

Can't delete gallery item:
  → Item is referenced (refs > 0)
  → Find all uses in image/sound lists
  → Update or delete references first

Items broken after upload:
  → Gallery references point to old IDs
  → Re-upload assets to gallery
  → Update URLs to new gallery references

Folder hierarchy broken:
  → Folder was renamed (changes name but not path)
  → Don't rename folders (known limitation)
  → Delete and recreate with correct name

PERFORMANCE ISSUES
──────────────────

Symptom: Slow, laggy, or freezing

Causes & Solutions:
  ✗ Too many images
    → Limit visible images (<100 at once)
    → Use scale ranges to hide distant layers
  
  ✗ Large image files
    → Compress images before uploading
    → Use external files instead of base64
  
  ✗ Large JSON file
    → Check file size (>50MB causes slowdown)
    → Move assets to img/sound folders
    → Clear unused gallery items
  
  ✗ Deep hierarchy
    → Flatten structure (<20 levels)
    → Split into separate map files
  
  ✗ Browser memory
    → Close other tabs
    → Restart browser
    → Use Chrome (best performance)

DATA CORRUPTION
───────────────

Symptom: Errors after editing JSON manually

Solutions:
  → Validate JSON syntax (jsonlint.com)
  → Check required fields present
  → Verify arrays not objects: config: [] not config: {}
  → No circular references in parent chains
  → Gallery IDs unique (no duplicates)
  → Restore from backup if needed

Observed slowdowns:
  • >10MB images: Load lag, render lag
  • >400MB JSON: 3-5 second save, 2-3 second parse
  • >40 gallery items: Gallery UI sluggish
  • >50 visible images: Frame rate drops
  • Deep hierarchy (>15 levels): Stack overflow risk

Optimization tips:
  • Compress images before upload
  • Use external files for large assets
  • Limit gallery size
  • Adjust scale ranges to reduce visible items
  • Close other browser tabs (free memory)

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
───────────────────────

Threats:
  • XSS via JSON injection (if loading untrusted JSON)
  • HTML in names not sanitized (gallery items, mark names)
  • CORS restrictions protect against malicious images
  • No authentication/authorization (local-only app)

Best practices:
  • Only load JSON from trusted sources
  • Avoid special characters in names (<, >, &, etc.)
  • Keep project files in secure location
  • No sensitive data in map files (assumed public)

EXTENDING THE APPLICATION
──────────────────────────

Custom mark icons:
  1. Create 24×24px SVG file
  2. Save to mark/ folder as newtype.svg
  3. Add to mark type dropdown in HTML
  4. Add CSS class .mark-newtype with background-image

Custom styling:
  • Edit CSS custom properties (:root section)
  • Modify colors, fonts, spacing
  • Responsive design possible (media queries)

New features:
  • Pure JavaScript (no transpilation needed)
  • Follow existing patterns (AppState, render loop)
  • Add to mode tabs or new sidebar sections
  • Update JSON schema if new data fields

FILE SIZE EXAMPLES
──────────────────

Typical project:
  • Small (RPG session): 1-5 MB JSON, 10-20 images, few sounds
  • Medium (region map): 10-30 MB JSON, 50-100 images, 10+ sounds
  • Large (full campaign): 50+ MB JSON, 200+ images, 20+ sounds

Base64 overhead:
  • 1 MB image → 1.33 MB base64 (+33%)
  • 5 MB image → 6.67 MB base64 (+33%)
  • 10× 5 MB images → 66.7 MB JSON

External files alternative:
  • JSON: <1 MB (just references)
  • img/ folder: 50 MB (actual images)
  • Total: 51 MB (but JSON loads fast)
  • Needed asset folder for sharing
